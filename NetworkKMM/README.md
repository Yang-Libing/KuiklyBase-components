## KMM Network

[中文文档](./README-zh.md)

### Introduction

This project is based on Kotlin Multiplatform technology and provides a cross-platform network request (http get/post, etc.) solution, supporting Android, iOS, and HarmonyOS mobile platforms.  
Currently, the HarmonyOS side uses the open-source library **libcurl** as the network request engine, while the Android/iOS sides temporarily use **ktor**. In the future, all platforms will be unified to use libcurl.

### Integration

#### Kotlin Integration
```kotlin
// Add the dependency in build.gradle.kts
implementation("com.tencent.kuiklybase:network:0.0.3")
// For more details, refer to the demo apps for each platform (see androidApp/, iosApp/, ohosApp/ directories)
```

#### Network Permission Declaration
##### Android
```kotlin
// Add in AndroidManifest.xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
```
##### HarmonyOS
```kotlin
// Add in the module.json5 file of your project
"requestPermissions": [
      {
        "name": "ohos.permission.INTERNET",
        "reason": "$string:reason",
        "usedScene": {
          "abilities": [
            "FormAbility"
          ],
          "when": "inuse"
        }
      },
      {
        "name": "ohos.permission.GET_NETWORK_INFO",
        "reason": "$string:reason",
        "usedScene": {
          "abilities": [
            "FormAbility"
          ],
          "when": "inuse"
        }
      },
      {
        "name": "ohos.permission.GET_WIFI_INFO",
        "reason": "$string:reason",
        "usedScene": {
          "abilities": [
            "FormAbility"
          ],
          "when": "inuse"
        }
      }
]
```

#### Initialization
```kotlin
val logImpl = object : IVBPBLog {
    override fun d(tag: String?, content: String?) {
        print("[$tag] $content\n")
    }

    override fun i(tag: String?, content: String?) {
        print("[$tag] $content\n")
    }

    override fun e(tag: String?, content: String?, throwable: Throwable?) {
        print("[$tag] $content\n")
    }
}
val config = VBTransportInitConfig()
config.logImpl = logImpl
VBTransportInitHelper.init(config)
```

### Common Network Request Examples
Some common HTTP GET/POST/string/byte request examples can be found in ***network/src/commonMain/service/VBTransportServiceTest.kt*** for your reference.

### Demo Project Usage Instructions
#### Android
Simply run the androidApp target.

#### iOS
```kotlin
1) Build the xcframework artifact. The Gradle task path is: NetworkKMM/network/Tasks/coocapods/podPublishDebugXCFramework
2) Open the iosApp/Podfile file and uncomment the following line:
   pod 'network', :path => '../network/build/cocoapods/publish/debug'
3) Open a terminal in the iosApp/Podfile directory and run: pod install
4) Open iosApp.xcworkspace in Xcode and run the project
```

#### HarmonyOS
```kotlin
1) Build the libkn.so artifact. The Gradle task path is: NetworkKMM/network-sample/build/ohosArm64Binaries
2) The generated libkn.so artifact can be found in the temporary build/bin/ohosArm64_debugShared/libkn.so folder of network-sample
3) Copy the libkn.so file to the ohosApp/entry/libs/ directory, overwriting the existing libkn.so file
4) Open the ohosApp project in DevEco-Studio and run it
```

### Notes
1. The HarmonyOS side currently uses the open-source library libcurl for network requests, but does not call libcurl interfaces directly. Instead, a wrapper layer is implemented for Kotlin to call. The wrapper code is located in: ohosApp/pbcurlwrapper/.
2. If you need to modify the logic of the wrapper layer, after making changes, build the artifact by executing Build/Make Module 'pbcurlwrapper' in DevEco-Studio. The artifact can be found in the temporary folder: pbcurlwrapper/build/default/intermediate/cmake/default/obj/arm64-v8a/libpbcurlwrapper.so.
3. If you want to run the ohosApp demo project after modification, you can manually copy the .so file from the build folder to entry/libs/arm64-v8a/, overwriting the original .so file.
